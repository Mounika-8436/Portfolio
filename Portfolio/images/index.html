        <h4>Programme Analyst Trainee!</h4>
        <p> Ever wondered what it takes to blend analytical precision with creativity? Let‚Äôs explore it together!Hello, I'm Mounika Eslavath, and I'm a student at Youngstown State University now working for a master's degree in information systems and computing.  From creating user-friendly WordPress websites to streamlining performance testing at Cognizant Technology Solutions, my path combines technical know-how with creativity.  I've created machine learning models and interesting instructional games in Python thanks to my solid engineering background and aptitude for problem-solving.  Because of my commitment to learning new technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing, I take great pride in my 3.9 GPA.  My work as a cashier improved my ability to serve customers and made me adaptable under duress.  Thrilled by software development and technological innovation?  Let's collaborate and create something truly remarkable!  üåî</p>

                <h2> C</h2>
                <p>The foundation of system programming is C, a strong, low-level, yet flexible programming language that connects hardware and software. High-performance computing is made possible by C, which Dennis Ritchie designed in the 1970s and offers direct memory control, pointer arithmetic, and minimal abstraction..</p>

                <p>Java is a scalable, secure, and high-performance language that runs on the JVM and allows for cross-platform execution. It is perfect for cloud computing, microservices, and enterprise applications because of its superiority in OOP, concurrency, memory management (GC), and reactive programming.</p>

                <p>By adding generic programming, OOP, and improved memory management to C, Bjarne Stroustrup created C++, a high-performance, multi-paradigm language, in 1983. Its speed, efficiency, and versatility make it a popular choice for real-time applications, operating systems, game engines, and financial systems.</p>

                <p>A web developer is a person who creates and manages digital content such as websites and applications. To make sure that the online experience is responsive, functional, and seamless, they work on both the front-end (UI/UX, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end (servers, databases, APIs). They make websites dynamic, intuitive, and user-friendly by fusing design with coding. üéçüíª.</p>

                <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, and flexible programming language that is renowned for being easy to understand and use. It is perfect for activities like automation, web development, machine learning, and data analysis. Python's dynamic typing, extensive standard library, and thriving third-party library ecosystem allow you to concentrate on problem-solving rather on syntax.

                    Because it comes with powerful tools, as its motto "batteries included" suggests, it is a favorite among both novices and specialists. </p>

Demographic (age, gender, occupation), psychographic (lifestyles, hobbies), behavioral (brand loyalty, usage frequency), and geographic criteria can all be used to create these groups. Customers are categorized according to their attributes using machine learning techniques like K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, PCA, decision trees, and neural networks .Application includes finance ,healthcare, telecom </p>

                        ‚Ä¢	The primary goal of supervised learning is to build a model that ‚Äúgeneralizes‚Äù. Here in this project, we make predictions on unseen data which is the data not used to train the model hence the machine learning model built should accurately predicts the species of future flowers rather than accurately predicting the label of already trained data.

Power systems are more susceptible to cyberattacks as they get increasingly digital and networked.  The project's objective is to develop a hierarchical, adaptive system that can track the power network, spot any odd or suspicious activity, and pinpoint the precise location of a cyberattack.  "Adaptive" refers to the system's capacity to learn from novel forms of assault, while "hierarchical" refers to the system's ability to be checked at several levels, beginning with local devices and progressing to regional systems and, ultimately, central control.</p>
